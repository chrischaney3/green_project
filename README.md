# Project 3 - Alternative Energy Sources for Vehicles across the United States
### UC Davis Data and Analytics Bootcamp 

### Team Members: Chris Chaney, Justin Dean, Katherine Winder, Madeline Gutieruiz, and Riley Unverferth

## Project Description
More than a dozen alternative fuels are in production or under development for use in alternative fuel vehicles and advanced technology vehicles. Government and private-sector fleets are the primary users for most of these fuels and vehicles, but individual consumers are increasingly interested in them. Using alternative fuels including electricity and advanced vehicles instead of conventional fuels and vehicles helps the United States conserve fuel and lower vehicle emissions. (AFDC, 2023)

This project will be looking at alternative fueling stations for vehicles throughout the United States. We will be diving into three different datasets to visualize these concepts, two from the Department of Energy and one from the U.S. Census. We will be mapping the fueling stations throughout the United States during 2021, looking at consumer use for alternative fuels per capita, and determining which states are alternative fuel friendly. 

## Data Used
### Original Data Sources

### Cleaned Data

## Research Questions
- What states have alternative fueling stations?
- What type of fueling stations are the most common within these states? 
- How many of these stations are private vs public?
- What are the charging stations per capita
- Where is the highest concentration of charging stations?
